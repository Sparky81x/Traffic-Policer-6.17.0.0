## Code & building
Quite simple, clone the repo, place the below dependencies into a new **Arrest Manager/dependencies** folder. It should then build without issue.

I know, I know, the code is FAR from perfect. 
This project sprung into life when I started learning C# and it originally started off as just a bit of toying around in my first ever object-oriented programming language.
Who remembers the More Jail Points and then the More Jail Points & Prisoner Transporter days? Yes, much of that (abysmal but functional) code remains today.

The code requires an enormous amount of refactoring and optimization work which I do not currently have the time for.
If you feel like it, please feel free to contribute by submitting a Pull Request. 
They may make it into a release and, of course, you'll be credited appropriately.
Obviously, feel free to use this as a resource to learn from and improve your programming skills for RPH (credits appreciated, please see licence also if copying/using larger parts of the code).
